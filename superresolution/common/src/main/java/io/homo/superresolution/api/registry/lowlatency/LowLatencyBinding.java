/**
 * Declaration that a frame generation backend is tied to (or incompatible with) a specific
 * low latency backend. The negotiator consults it when picking a {@code (fg, ll)} pair.
 * <p>
 * {@link Kind#REQUIRES} means the FG backend only runs when the negotiator has selected the
 * named LL backend (Streamline FG requires Streamline Reflex — DLSS-G's present pacing
 * depends on it).
 * <p>
 * {@link Kind#EXCLUDES} means the FG backend must not be paired with the named LL backend
 * (NVNGX FG under the Streamline interposer is untested and disallowed here).
 * <p>
 * {@link Kind#NONE} means no constraint.
