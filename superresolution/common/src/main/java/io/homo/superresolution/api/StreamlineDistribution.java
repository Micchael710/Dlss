 * {@code sl.reflex.dll}, {@code sl.pcl.dll}, {@code NvLowLatencyVk.dll}).
 * <p>
 * The distributor calls {@link #provide(Supplier)} from its mod entrypoint (which fires
 * before {@code Minecraft.<init>}, i.e. before SR reads its configuration or decides
 * whether to initialize Streamline). The supplier is only consulted lazily, when SR
 * actually needs the directory; a distributor is free to defer extraction until then.
 * <p>
 * When no distributor is registered, SR's Streamline paths are silently disabled and
 * frame generation falls back to any non-Streamline backend that happens to be
 * registered (typically NVNGX from Wisteria).
